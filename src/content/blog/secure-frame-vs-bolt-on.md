Not all raised toilet seats are created equal—and the **way they attach** makes a big difference in stability, comfort, and ease of use.

If you're choosing between a **bolt-on riser** or a **freestanding toilet safety frame**, this guide will help you weigh the pros, cons, and ideal use cases.

## 🚽 What Is a Bolt-On Riser?

A bolt-on raised toilet seat:
- Installs **directly to the toilet bowl**
- Usually replaces the original seat  
- Secured with 2 long bolts or side clamps

**Pros:**
✅ Very secure  
✅ Compact footprint  
✅ Some are bidet-compatible  

**Cons:**
❌ Requires tools to install  
❌ May wobble over time  
❌ Not easy to remove and reattach

> Best for long-term use or smaller bathrooms.

## 🪑 What Is a Toilet Safety Frame?

A freestanding frame:
- Sits **over the toilet** with its own legs  
- Often includes armrests and a padded seat  
- Does not bolt to the toilet itself

**Pros:**
✅ Great for people with balance issues  
✅ Easy to reposition  
✅ Can be used in multiple bathrooms  

**Cons:**
❌ Takes up more space  
❌ Legs must be adjusted for stability  
❌ Can slide if not fitted properly

> Best for short-term recovery or higher fall risk.
