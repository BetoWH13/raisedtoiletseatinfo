Toilets are not one-height-fits-all.

If you’re struggling to sit or stand due to **low seat height**, you don’t necessarily need a brand-new fixture. There are simple ways to **raise your toilet height** without calling a plumber—or shelling out hundreds.

Here are your best options.

---

## 🚽 1. Use a Raised Toilet Seat

Obvious? Yes.  
Still the easiest and most popular option? Also yes.

### Types:
- **Clamp-on risers** – install in seconds  
- **Bolt-on risers** – more secure, longer-term  
- **Risers with handles** – ideal for stability

Height range: **2–6 inches** boost  
✅ Removable  
✅ Portable  
✅ Bidet-compatible (some models)

---

## 🪑 2. Try a Toilet Seat Elevator

Unlike risers that replace the seat, an **elevator** installs **between the toilet bowl and the existing seat**.

- Bolts on using original mounting holes  
- Still lets you use your original seat/lid  
- Often looks more integrated  

> Great for people who want a more “normal” appearance.

---

## 🧱 3. Add a Toilet Base Riser (Plumber Required)

This is a **permanent solution** that raises the **entire toilet** by 2–3 inches.

- Installs under the base  
- Requires removing and resealing the toilet  
- Not a DIY job for most

Best for:
- Long-term accessibility needs  
- Homes with multiple users needing height support

---

## 🧰 4. Use a Frame or Commode Chair

Freestanding frames can raise height by **adjusting the legs**, especially:
- Toilet safety frames  
- Bedside commodes repurposed over toilet  
- Portable riser systems with adjustable feet

✅ No installation needed  
✅ Great for short-term use  
⚠️ Takes up space

---

## ✨ 5. Bonus: Swap to a Comfort Height Toilet (Eventually)

Standard toilets = 15" height  
Comfort-height = ~17–19" (ADA standard)

If you’re renovating down the road, this upgrade may eliminate the need for add-ons.
