## 🧻 Raised Seat + Bidet? Don't Guess—Checklist It.

Some combos just don't work.  
Before you waste time, tools, or 💸, use this quick checklist to see if your riser and bidet can **peacefully coexist**.

You can print this, save it, or use it as a **prep list** before buying anything.

---

## 🚽 1. Seat Bolt Compatibility

**❓ Does your riser attach using the toilet seat bolts?**  
- [ ] YES – ⚠️ Likely conflict with bidet base plate  
- [ ] NO – ✅ May be compatible  

> 💡 If your riser bolts on *below* the seat, your bidet will likely have no room.

---

## 🧠 2. Space for Bidet Plate

**❓ Is there about 0.5" of extra space between your toilet bowl and riser?**  
- [ ] YES – ✅ That’s enough for a bidet plate  
- [ ] NO – ⚠️ You’ll crush the bidet mount  

> Bidet attachments sit on a thin plate between the bowl and seat—it needs room to breathe.

---

## 💦 3. Nozzle Zone Clearance

**❓ Does your riser leave the *rear rim* of the bowl open?**  
- [ ] YES – ✅ Spray path is clear  
- [ ] NO – ⚠️ Nozzle may hit plastic or be blocked

> No clearance = no cleaning. Not good.

---

## 🔧 4. Water Line Accessibility

**❓ Is the water inlet valve easy to access near the toilet tank?**  
- [ ] YES – ✅ You can install the T-adapter easily  
- [ ] NO – ⚠️ Installation may require extra parts

> If your riser makes the tank area hard to reach, even the water connection becomes a pain.

---

## 📐 5. Seat Height Considerations

**❓ After installing the riser and bidet, will the seat be too high to sit safely?**  
- [ ] NO – ✅ That’s fine  
- [ ] YES – ⚠️ Consider a lower-profile riser or frame

> A combined height over ~21" can cause leg strain or balance issues.

---

## 💡 Compatibility Score

**Mostly ✅s?** You’re good to go!  
**Mostly ⚠️s?** Time to rethink your combo.

Nova’s recommendations:
- 👉 Use **hinged risers** that mount *above* the bidet
- 👉 Try **toilet safety frames** instead of risers
- 👉 Or go all-in with a **bidet + riser integrated unit**
