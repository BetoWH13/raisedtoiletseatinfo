The idea sounds simple: raise the seat, clean with a bidet, enjoy the best of both worlds.  
The reality? 🤨 A lot of plastic-on-plastic chaos if you're not careful.

Here’s the honest breakdown on whether and how you can install a bidet *under* a raised toilet seat.

---

## 🚫 The Compatibility Problem

Most bidet attachments are **designed to be sandwiched** between your toilet bowl and the existing seat.

But most raised toilet seats:
- Replace the entire seat  
- Sit on top of the bowl  
- Use completely different mounting hardware  
- Don’t play nice with layered plastic

> Translation: **stacking a riser over a bidet plate is a wobbly mess.**

## ✅ Bidet-Compatible Riser Types (Yes, They Exist)

Some bolt-on risers now offer **open mounting holes** to accommodate a bidet plate.

### Look for:
- **“Bidet-compatible riser”** in the product title  
- Extra-long mounting slots  
- No plastic base in the bolt zone  
- Universal bolt pattern

Popular options:
- Vaunn Medical Bolt-On Riser  
- Carex elongated bidet-compatible models (check specs)

## 🛠️ How to Make It Work

Here’s what works if you're DIY-hungry:

### Option 1: **Bolt-On Riser + Bidet Plate + Long Bolts**
- Place bidet plate on bowl  
- Place riser on top  
- Use **extra-long bolts** to go through all layers  
- Tighten carefully (don’t strip plastic!)

> May require nylon spacers or rubber washers to stabilize.

---

### Option 2: **Use a Toilet Seat Elevator Instead**
- Elevator goes under original seat  
- Original seat mounts over bidet  
- ✅ Clean install  
- ✅ No extra height wobble  
- ⚠️ Only raises 2 inches typically

---

## ⚠️ What Doesn’t Work (Don’t Try It)

- Clamp-on risers: not compatible at all  
- Frames with built-in seats: can’t stack with bidets  
- Risers without bolt slots: no way to secure bidet plate  
- Adhesive risers + bidet = a slip-n-slide horror movie

---

## 💡 Final Flush

You *can* use a bidet with a raised seat, but you need:
- The right kind of riser  
- Long mounting bolts  
- A little patience and creativity

And if all else fails?  
Consider a **handheld bidet sprayer** and skip the seat-mount drama entirely.
