## 🧓 Hygiene Meets Reality

You’ve already installed a raised toilet seat to make life easier.  
Now you’re trying to add a bidet—but surprise! It doesn’t fit. The riser’s in the way. The bolts don’t line up. The universe says “nope.”

But you **still** deserve dignity, hygiene, and comfort.  
Good news: there are *real workarounds*—and some may actually work **better** for your needs.

## 🧠 Nova’s Senior-Friendly Take

If you're a senior—or shopping for one—and your riser refuses to budge:

- Try a **handheld sprayer** if independent use is possible  
- Use a **toilet safety frame** and remove the riser entirely  
- Consider a **chair-mounted solution** if assistance is needed  
- Pack a **portable bidet** for travel or post-op care

## 💬 Final Thought

A clean and comfortable bathroom routine *shouldn’t require a master’s degree in toilet mechanics*.  
The solutions above are **simple, safe, and bidet-ish enough** to get the job done.
