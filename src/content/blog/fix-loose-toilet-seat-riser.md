A raised toilet seat should feel stable, not like a carnival ride.  
But over time, even the best risers can **loosen, shift, or squeak**, creating a safety risk for seniors or anyone with mobility concerns.

Here’s how to fix it—fast and safely.

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Identify the Wobble Type

There are two kinds of wobbles:
1. **Lateral shift** – side-to-side movement  
2. **Front-to-back rock** – riser tips forward or back slightly

Knowing which one you have helps you target the problem area.

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Check the Mounting Bolts

If your riser is bolted to the toilet:
- Lift the seat/lid and look for bolts passing through the riser  
- Are they loose? Are the nuts underneath tight?

Use a flathead screwdriver + wrench to gently tighten both sides.

> 🧠 Don’t overtighten—plastic bolts can crack.

---

## 🧲 Step 3: Inspect Side Clamps or Locking Mechanisms

If your riser has side arms or clamp-style locks:
- Twist or pull each one to see if they grip the porcelain snugly  
- Wipe away any debris between riser and bowl  
- Retighten as needed

**Clamps can wear out**—if they no longer hold tension, replace them.

---

## 🧼 Step 4: Clean the Contact Surface

Sometimes wobble is caused by:
- Dust or moisture under the riser  
- Compressed foam bumpers  
- Uneven rim contact

Clean the toilet rim and riser base with rubbing alcohol, then reset.

---

## ✂️ Step 5: Add Friction (if needed)

If everything's tight but still slippery, try adding:
- Rubber washers under the riser  
- Non-slip foam tape  
- New seat bumpers (many risers have replaceable pads)

---

## ⚠️ Step 6: Retire the Riser If It’s Damaged

If:
- The plastic frame is cracked  
- Threads are stripped  
- Mounts no longer hold

…it’s time to replace it. Wobble = fall hazard. Don’t risk it.

---

## 🔧 Tools That Help:

- Flathead screwdriver  
- ½" wrench or adjustable pliers  
- Replacement bolt kit  
- Alcohol wipes  
- Optional: anti-slip bumpers or riser pads

---

## 💡 Final Flush

You don’t need to live with a wobbly seat.  
Most fixes take 5–10 minutes—and a single $5 part.
