Raising your toilet seat height can make a **huge difference** in comfort and mobility. Whether you're recovering from surgery, assisting a loved one, or just future-proofing your bathroom—installing a riser is a smart move.

The best part? You can do it yourself in under 15 minutes.  
Let’s break it down.

## 🧰 What You’ll Need

- Your raised toilet seat (obviously)  
- A screwdriver (flathead or Phillips)  
- Optional: wrench or pliers  
- Alcohol wipes or bathroom cleaner  
- (Optional) the original toilet seat if keeping it installed

## 🚽 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Clean the Toilet Rim**

Use alcohol wipes or a mild cleaner to clean the toilet bowl’s rim.  
This prevents slipping and ensures better grip.

---

### 2. **Remove the Original Seat (if needed)**

Some risers go **under** the seat, some go **in place** of the seat.

- To remove: Pop open the seat bolt covers  
- Unscrew both mounting bolts  
- Lift off the seat and lid

> 🧠 Tip: Save the original hardware in a ziplock bag.

---

### 3. **Position the Riser**

Center the riser on the toilet bowl, aligning the holes or clamps:

- **Bolt-on risers**: Holes should line up with the toilet bolt holes  
- **Clamp-on risers**: Side arms should rest against the outer rim

---

### 4. **Secure the Riser**

Depending on the type:

#### 🔩 Bolt-On
- Drop bolts through riser → bowl → use washers + nuts below  
- Tighten evenly on both sides  
- Don’t overtighten! Stripped plastic = future wobble

#### 🔧 Clamp-On
- Twist the knobs to tighten the clamps against the bowl  
- Make sure they feel firm—not crushing

---

### 5. **Reattach the Original Seat (Optional)**

Some risers allow you to place the seat **on top of the riser**.  
If yours does:
- Line it up over the riser  
- Thread bolts through both  
- Tighten gently

---

### 6. **Test the Fit**

- Sit down carefully  
- Wiggle slightly  
- Listen for squeaks or sliding

If it shifts? Re-tighten or add bumpers.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Overtightening bolts** – can crack plastic or porcelain  
- **Forgetting to clean the rim** – causes slipping  
- **Not aligning clamps evenly** – leads to wobble  
- **Skipping the test sit** – dangerous surprise later!
