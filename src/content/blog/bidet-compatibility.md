## 😬 The Compatibility Crisis

It sounds simple: you want a raised toilet seat for comfort or mobility *and* a bidet for hygiene.  
But combine them… and suddenly the toilet becomes a hostile battlefield.

Here’s the truth: **most raised toilet seats were never designed to work with bidet attachments**.

---

## 🚽 Why They Don’t Fit (Literally)

1. **They block the bidet’s nozzle zone**  
   Raised seats often extend below the toilet rim, interfering with where bidet attachments spray from.

2. **They disrupt bidet attachment hardware**  
   Many risers attach directly under the toilet seat bolts—**the exact same bolts** a bidet needs.

3. **They aren’t stable with bidets underneath**  
   Even if you *can* squeeze a bidet in, the raised seat may wobble or come loose over time.

## 💡 Smart Workarounds

Here are options that actually work—**tested and trusted**:

### ✅ Hinged or Cutout Risers  
These lift **above** the bidet attachment, reducing conflict.

> Look for “hinged risers” or risers labeled “bidet-compatible.”  
> Brands like Carex, Vive, and Bemis have bidet-friendly models.

### ✅ Separate Toilet Frames  
Use a **standalone frame with armrests** instead of a bolt-on riser. This keeps the toilet seat free for a bidet attachment.

### ✅ Specialized Bidet-Riser Combos  
A few bidet companies now offer **integrated solutions**—all-in-one bidet + riser seats.

> These cost more but **solve every compatibility problem at once**.

## 🔧 What to Do Right Now
