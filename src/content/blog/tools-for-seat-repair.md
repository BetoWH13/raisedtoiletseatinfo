You don’t need a contractor’s license to repair a raised toilet seat—just a few basic tools and the confidence to tighten a bolt without cracking your bowl.

Here’s a complete list of what you actually need to keep your seat stable, safe, and functional.

---

## 🔧 1. Flathead Screwdriver

The single most useful tool for:
- Tightening riser bolts  
- Adjusting clamp brackets  
- Removing toilet seat covers

**Tip:** Use a wide blade for better grip on plastic bolts.

---

## 🔩 2. Adjustable Wrench or ½" Box Wrench

Used to hold nuts underneath the toilet bowl while tightening from above.

✅ Works with most universal bolt kits  
✅ Provides more control than pliers

**Important:** Use gentle pressure to avoid cracking porcelain or stripping plastic threads.

## 🧼 3. Cleaning Supplies

Before doing *anything*, clean the toilet rim and riser base.

Best options:
- Alcohol wipes  
- Degreaser + paper towel  
- Toothbrush for gunked-up hinges

**Clean contact = less wobble.** Simple.

## 🧰 4. Replacement Bolt Kit (Optional)

If bolts are stripped, rusted, or missing, have a spare kit ready:
- 2–3” nylon or stainless steel bolts  
- Washers + wingnuts  
- Optional rubber spacers

## 🧲 5. Rubber Bumpers or Non-Slip Pads

These aren’t always included—but they make a big difference in stability.

Look for:
- Adhesive rubber pads  
- Foam bumpers (like what come with bidets)  
- Grippy silicone tape

Apply them to the base of the riser to reduce lateral movement.
