When your raised toilet seat starts wobbling, shifting, or making that ominous creak, chances are **a single $3 part is to blame**. But how do you find it… when you don’t even know what it’s called?

This guide walks you through the **most common raised toilet seat components**, with plain-English definitions and tips on what to buy when they break.

## 🪛 1. Seat Riser Bolts

These long screws or bolts connect the riser to the toilet bowl—often through the same holes your regular seat uses.

- Usually plastic or stainless steel
- May include washers or bushings
- Often **specific to the riser brand**

> 🔍 Tip: If yours are stripped or missing, search “[Brand] raised toilet seat replacement bolts” or try a universal bolt kit.

---

## 🧲 2. Locking Brackets / Side Clamps

These are the **plastic arms or side clamps** that twist and tighten against the toilet rim. They keep the riser from shifting sideways.

- Not all risers have these
- Can wear out or break if overtightened

---

## 🧼 3. Cushion Bumpers

Foam or rubber bumpers found on the underside of the seat or riser. These protect the porcelain and reduce slipping.

- Also known as riser pads or friction feet
- Can flatten over time

---

## 🔧 4. Hinges (for Flip-Up Risers)

Some risers are hinged for cleaning access or bidet compatibility. These hinges **often break first**.

- Check for wiggling or resistance
- Some are bolted in; others are molded into the seat

---

## 🪑 5. Armrest Locks / Handles

If your riser has built-in arms, there may be **locking mechanisms** or buttons to detach or fold them.

- Often spring-loaded
- Can loosen over time or jam

---

## 💡 Final Flush

Knowing what to search for is half the battle. Here's a cheat sheet to copy:

**Search terms that actually work:**
- “Toilet riser replacement bolts”
- “Raised seat locking clamp parts”
- “Riser bumpers pads kit”
- “Toilet seat hinge repair”
