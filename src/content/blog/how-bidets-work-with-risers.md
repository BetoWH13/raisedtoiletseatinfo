## 🧠 Before You Blame the Bidet…

If your raised toilet seat and bidet aren't getting along, the problem isn’t personal—it’s mechanical.

Let’s look under the lid and break down **how bidet attachments actually work**, and what you *must* understand before combining them with any riser or frame.

## 🔧 How Bidet Attachments Install

Most bidets (like TUSHY, Luxe Bidet, Brondell) use a **nozzle base plate** that installs under your toilet seat.

### 👇 The Setup:
1. Remove your existing toilet seat
2. Place the **bidet attachment plate** over the bolt holes
3. Reattach the seat using the same bolts (through both layers)
4. Connect the water line (no electricity needed for basic models)

⚠️ **Key Insight**: That mounting plate is about 0.25–0.5" thick—and **many risers also want that bolt space**.

## 💦 How Bidets Actually Spray

Most bidet attachments use a **retractable nozzle** that:
- Extends when water pressure is applied  
- Sprays from just under the rear rim of the toilet  
- Cleans front or rear depending on the model

### 🚫 The Problem With Risers:
- If your riser **dips too low**, it *blocks the nozzle’s range*
- If your riser **adds bulk around the bolts**, the bidet plate can’t mount securely
- If the seat ends up **too far from the bowl**, the spray might *miss entirely*

## 🧻 Why Compatibility Matters

This isn’t just about comfort—it’s about function and hygiene.  
Poor compatibility leads to:

- Wobbling toilet seats  
- Sprays missing the target  
- Nozzle damage  
- Leaks from stressed fittings  
- Incomplete cleaning

🙃 AKA: A wet mess and a refund request.

## 🧠 Smart Compatibility Tips

Here’s how to make them work together like besties:

### ✅ Use a Hinged Riser  
It installs **above** the bidet plate, giving everyone space.

### ✅ Choose a Frame Instead of a Riser  
Toilet safety frames give height without blocking the seat bolts.

### ✅ Shop Combo Units  
Some brands now sell risers specifically **designed to accommodate bidets**.

## 💡 Nova’s Checklist

Before you buy a bidet + riser combo, confirm:

- [ ] Does the riser go **above** or **below** the seat bolts?  
- [ ] Will the riser block the **rear nozzle path**?  
- [ ] Is there enough clearance for water hose connection?  
- [ ] Do others report using this combo *successfully*?

## 🧴 Final Thought

**Bidet attachments aren’t complicated.**  
But pair them with a bad riser, and it’s like trying to wear snow boots over roller skates.  
Get the setup right—and your bathroom becomes a throne room again.
