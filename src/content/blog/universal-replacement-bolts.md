If you’ve lost a bolt, stripped a thread, or watched your riser **do the twist** every time you sit down, you’re not alone.

But can you just walk into a hardware store and grab *any* toilet seat bolt to fix it?

Short answer: **Yes… but also, no.**  
Here’s what you need to know about “universal” toilet seat bolts—and when they work (or don’t) for raised seats.

## 🔩 Standard Toilet Bolts: What They Are

Most standard toilet seat bolts:
- Are about 2.5 inches long  
- Use nylon or stainless steel  
- Fit through the bowl’s rear mounting holes  
- Use a wingnut underneath to tighten

> 🛠 For *regular* seats, this works 99% of the time.

## 🚽 Raised Seat = Extra Layers

When you add a riser, the bolt now has to:
- Pass through the **bidet plate** (if applicable)  
- Pass through the **riser base**  
- Still anchor securely to the bowl  

If your bolt is too short, or the **thread doesn't match**, you're stuck with a wobbly mess.

## ✅ When Universal Bolts *Do* Work

- You’re using a **non-locking er** with standard spacing  
- You’re **not** using a bidet between the riser and seat  
- The bolt is **long enough** (look for 3\"+ bolt kits)  
- You use washers to ensure stability

Look for:
- “Universal toilet seat bolts long”
- “Raised toilet seat bolt kit”

---

## 🚫 When They *Don't* Work

- You have a riser with **non-standard spacing**  
- The riser **requires a proprietary clip or bracket**  
- You’re trying to install over a bidet base that shifts the alignment  
- Your toilet is **elongated** with deeper rear holes

## 💡 Nova’s Bolt Compatibility Checklist

- [ ] Bolt length at least 3 inches?  
- [ ] Threads match your seat/riser insert?  
- [ ] Washer + nut included?  
- [ ] Can you tighten it without stripping plastic?  
- [ ] No risk of overtightening near porcelain?

## 🧠 Final Verdict

There’s no truly “one size fits all” bolt—but many options **do fit most** risers if you check the specs.

If all else fails, look up the exact riser brand and model.  
Then go for the OEM bolt kit or a “universal extra-long bolt set.”
