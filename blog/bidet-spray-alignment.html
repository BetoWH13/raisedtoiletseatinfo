# Bidet Spray Too Low? Fixing Misaligned Nozzles with Elevated Seats

> **Problem:** Your bidet's spray doesn’t hit the right spot anymore. If you’re using a raised toilet seat, you’re not imagining things—the nozzle's aim is off.

---

## 🎯 Why the Spray Is Missing the Mark

Bidets are calibrated for a specific **body-to-nozzle distance**. When you elevate the seat, the user’s body shifts **2 to 6 inches higher**, and the spray angle no longer aligns correctly.

This is especially common with:

* Clamp-on risers
* Hinged seats with risers
* Any riser + bidet seat combo that hasn’t been optimized

The result?

* Spray aimed too low
* Weak or no contact
* Splashing or backfire

## 🔍 Key Reasons for Misaligned Spray

### 1. **Seat Height Increases**

The higher the seat, the farther your body is from the nozzle’s fixed location.

### 2. **Fixed Nozzle Position**

Most bidet seats use a fixed or semi-fixed nozzle location. Some offer basic adjustability, but not enough for high risers.

### 3. **Nozzle Sensor Confusion**

In electric models, seat sensors may not engage properly with the user's elevated posture.

## ✅ Solutions That Actually Work

### 1. **Choose a Bidet with Adjustable Nozzles**

Look for models with **multi-angle spray control**, like:

* **TOTO Washlet C5**
* **Brondell Swash 1400**

These help compensate for elevated seating by letting you adjust the direction.

### 2. **Use a Compatible Riser**

Brands like Carex and Bemis offer risers designed to work **with bidets**, maintaining better geometry.

### 3. **Elevate the Toilet Instead**

Using a **toilevator** lifts the whole toilet, preserving bidet-to-user alignment.

### 4. **Handheld Bidets for Manual Control**

A handheld sprayer allows the user (or caregiver) to aim directly regardless of seat height.

## 📏 Test It: The Paper Towel Trick

Want to test nozzle alignment?

1. Place a folded paper towel on the seat (where spray should hit)
2. Activate the spray function
3. Watch where the spray lands

If it’s too far back or forward, your seat height is disrupting the spray angle.

## 🛠 Installation Tips for Alignment

* Use extended bolts if combining bidet + riser
* Secure everything to avoid wobble (which shifts spray accuracy)
* Confirm seat sensors are triggered correctly in electric models
