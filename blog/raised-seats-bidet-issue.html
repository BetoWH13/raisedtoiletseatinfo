# Why Most Raised Toilet Seats Aren’t Bidet-Friendly (And What to Do About It)

> **Short on time?** Raised toilet seats often block or interfere with bidet attachments—but there are simple, compatible solutions you can install today.

## 🚽 The Problem: Raised Seats and Bidets Don’t Naturally Mix

Raised toilet seats are essential for seniors and people with limited mobility. They make it easier and safer to sit and stand.

But if you’re adding a bidet for hygiene? That’s where things get tricky.

Most raised toilet seats **aren’t designed with bidets in mind**, especially:

* Clamp-on models
* Armrest risers
* Basic set-on seats

These create **fit issues**, misalign spray nozzles, or block the mounting area entirely.

---

## ⚠️ Common Compatibility Issues

### 1. **No Flat Mounting Area**

Clamp-on and set-on risers often sit **directly on the bowl**, leaving no room for a bidet attachment or bidet seat bracket.

### 2. **Spray Misalignment**

Elevating the seat shifts your body higher than the bidet’s nozzle range. Result? Weak spray or total misfire.

### 3. **Blocked Controls or Hoses**

Armrests and bulky risers can cover bidet controls or the area where the water hose needs to connect.

### 4. **Bolt Length Problems**

Combining a riser and a bidet seat can exceed standard bolt lengths, causing instability or outright failure.

## ✅ What Actually Works (Bidet-Compatible Solutions)

Despite these challenges, there are **smart fixes**:

### 🔧 Use a Riser Designed for Bidets

Some brands make **under-seat risers** compatible with bidet seats.

* Example: **Carex Bidet Seat Riser** — fits under Brondell Swash models
* Includes extended hardware to solve bolt-length issues

### 🔁 Replace the Whole Unit

Go with an **all-in-one product** like:

* **Bemis Clean Shield with Personal Wash Bidet**
* **Drive PreserveTech Raised Toilet Seat with Bidet**

These are engineered for height and hygiene from the start.

### ⬆️ Elevate the Toilet Instead

Use a **Toilevator** to raise the toilet’s base.

* Keeps original geometry
* Bidet seat installs like normal

### 💧 Consider a Handheld Bidet

These flexible sprayers attach to your toilet tank and bypass risers entirely.

* Great for users with caregiver assistance
* Affordable and compatible with any setup

## 🧠 Bonus Tip: Check Spray Angle Before You Buy

Some bidet seats have **adjustable nozzles**, which help compensate for elevation changes.

Still, if your seat lifts more than 3 inches, nozzle alignment may never hit the mark. That’s why **purpose-built risers or integrated units** are the best long-term solution.
