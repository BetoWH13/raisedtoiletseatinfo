## üß± What Is a Toilevator?

A **toilevator**, often referred to as a toilet base riser, is a specially designed platform that sits directly beneath your toilet, raising the entire fixture by approximately 2 to 4 inches. Unlike traditional raised toilet seats that sit on top of the bowl, the toilevator lifts the **entire toilet unit**, including the bowl, seat, and any accessories like a bidet.

It‚Äôs especially useful for people who:

* Require additional toilet height to ease sitting and standing due to age, injury, or disability
* Prefer not to use **temporary or removable risers** that can look bulky or feel unstable
* Want full, trouble-free compatibility with **bidet seats or attachments** that may otherwise not work properly with added risers

Most importantly, the toilevator maintains the **original geometry of your toilet**, which is crucial for preserving proper alignment and function when using a bidet system.

## üõ† How It Works

Unlike most seat risers that alter the way the toilet functions or feels, the toilevator is installed **at the base of the toilet**, which ensures a more natural and stable modification. Here‚Äôs how the installation typically works:

1. The water supply is shut off and the toilet is disconnected.
2. The toilet is carefully lifted from its current position.
3. The toilevator platform is placed and aligned with the existing flange and bolt holes.
4. The toilet is then reinstalled on top using extended bolts and a new wax ring for sealing.

The result is a seamless lift of the entire fixture, allowing **both mobility support and bidet use without compromise**.

## ‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Ideal for Bidets

### 1. **Preserves Spray Alignment**

Raising only the seat causes misalignment with the bidet's nozzle, often resulting in ineffective or misdirected spray. A toilevator, on the other hand, lifts everything uniformly, keeping the user in the ideal spray zone.

### 2. **Avoids Riser-Related Obstructions**

Unlike bulky clamp-on risers, a toilevator does not interfere with the toilet‚Äôs seat hardware, control panels, or bidet water lines. There‚Äôs **nothing in the way**.

### 3. **Universal Bidet Compatibility**

Whether you're using:

* High-end electric bidet seats (e.g., **TOTO Washlet**, **BioBidet Bliss**)
* Simple bidet attachments
* Manual sprayers or travel bidets

A toilevator enables **all types of bidets to function as designed**, without the seat sensor or spray-angle issues common with elevated seats.

### 4. **Stable, Secure, and Discreet**

With its hidden placement under the toilet, a toilevator provides enhanced safety and stability while maintaining a clean, unobtrusive look. No wobbly risers. No odd accessories. Just a properly elevated toilet.
