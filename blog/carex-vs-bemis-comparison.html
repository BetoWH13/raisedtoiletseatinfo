# Carex vs Bemis: Which Bidet-Compatible Riser Should You Buy?

> If you’re shopping for a raised toilet seat that plays nicely with your bidet, you’ve probably already run into a frustrating truth: most risers and bidets don’t get along. Fortunately, two brands—**Carex** and **Bemis**—have stepped up to fill the gap. But they offer very different solutions. So which one is the right fit for your bathroom setup?

This in-depth comparison breaks down the key differences between the **Carex Bidet Seat Riser** and the **Bemis Clean Shield Raised Toilet Seat with Bidet**, helping you make the best choice based on your needs, space, and personal preferences.

## 🧩 Understanding the Compatibility Challenge

Traditional raised toilet seats are often designed without bidet compatibility in mind. They can block water spray, interfere with nozzle sensors, or sit too high or too awkwardly for bidet mechanisms to work properly. This creates a major barrier for anyone who needs extra toilet height but doesn’t want to give up the hygiene benefits of a bidet.

Carex and Bemis each take a different path to solve this issue:

* **Carex** offers an **under-seat riser** that maintains compatibility with third-party bidet seats.
* **Bemis** builds a **fully integrated solution** that combines elevation, a support frame, and a bidet sprayer into one plug-and-play product.

Let’s explore both options in depth.
